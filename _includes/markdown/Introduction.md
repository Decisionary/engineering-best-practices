### Audience

These Engineering Best Practices are not geared to teach anyone to become an engineer. Rather, they aim to illustrate how to engineer the Decisionary way. Therefore, these best practices are intended for capable engineers.

We are constantly challenging ourselves and learning. Knowledge gives us a competitive edge. Everyone around us is growing; if we stop growing individually or collectively and stop challenging ourselves to improve, we fall behind. For that reason, this document is not set in stone and will change. Evolving these best practices through contributions is incredibly important to us.
